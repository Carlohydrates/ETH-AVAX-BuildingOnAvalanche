# DegenToken ERC20 Smart Contract

This smart contract, `DegenToken`, implements an ERC20 token on the Ethereum blockchain. It includes functionality for minting new tokens, redeeming tokens for in-game items, burning tokens, and transferring tokens between users.

## Features

### Minting New Tokens

The contract owner has the exclusive capability to mint new tokens and distribute them to specified addresses.

### Redeeming Tokens

Players can redeem their tokens for in-game items. The contract currently supports three choices:

1. **Choice 1**: Redeem for an item that costs 50 tokens.
2. **Choice 2**: Redeem for an item that costs 100 tokens.
3. **Choice 3**: Redeem for an item that costs 150 tokens.

### Burning Tokens

Users have the ability to burn their own tokens, removing them permanently from circulation.

### Transferring Tokens

Users can transfer tokens to other addresses by using the `transferTokens` function, which approves a certain amount and performs the transfer.

## Functions Overview

- `mint`: Mint new tokens and assign them to a specified address.
- `redeem`: Allow users to redeem tokens for in-game items based on their choice.
- `burn`: Enable users to burn their tokens, reducing the token supply.
- `transferTokens`: Facilitate the transfer of tokens between addresses.

## Usage

1. **Minting Tokens**: Only the contract owner can mint new tokens. Use the `mint` function, providing the receiver's address and the number of tokens to mint.

2. **Redeeming Tokens**: Players can redeem tokens by calling the `redeem` function and specifying the token value and their choice of item (1, 2, or 3).

3. **Burning Tokens**: Users can burn their tokens by calling the `burn` function, providing the number of tokens they want to burn.

4. **Transferring Tokens**: Users can transfer tokens to other addresses using the `transferTokens` function, specifying the receiver's address and the number of tokens to transfer.

## Deployment

Deploy the smart contract to the Ethereum blockchain using Remix or any other Ethereum development environment.
